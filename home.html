                Home is sanctuary. <BR>

                Home represents a constant point to return to in the ever changing world. Home is a refuge for
                the mental and physical self, a buffer from the unpredictable world. It is simple and primal. The grounded home alleviates the troubled mind of excess. It resolves spaces with restraint and purity. Perhaps the idea of permanence can take place in a home where the walls and floors themselves become the mass from which life is sculpted. The spaces, as if carved from stone, replace the need for temporal furniture. There is a sense of ambiguity as to the form or material because a home is different for everyone. But what they all have in common is the idea of a home being a symbol of stability. <BR>  Within the home takes place a ritual of living, a routine so clearly defined by the inhabitant that
                the home becomes a solid backbone to one’s life. It can be choreographed by one’s
                surroundings ― where the architecture speaks to you and directs you to the next step. This linear concept can thereafter be translated into any form for a building.
